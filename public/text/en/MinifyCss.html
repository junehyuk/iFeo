<p>Minifying CSS is just what the name implies... making your CSS instructions smaller. The main way to get this done is through online tools, which we will discuss below.</p>

<h2>How to Minify CSS</h2>

<p>Online tools are available to do this. This website has one such tool and I will describe how to minify your CSS on that tool (or just go to our <a href="http://www.feedthebot.com/tools/css/">Minify CSS tool</a>).</p>



<p>Below are some CSS instructions that are formatted using alot of whitespace (not good for file size)...</p>


<div class="code">
<p>body<br>
{<br>
background-color:#d0e4fe;<br>
}<br>
h1<br>
{<br>
color:orange;<br>
text-align:center;<br>
}
</p>
</div>

<p>That code can be copied and pasted into our tool and the resulting code will look like this...</p>
<div class="code">
<p>body {background-color:#d0e4fe;}<br>
h1 {color:orange;text-align:center;}</p>
</div>

<p>The minified code is smaller in file size, and also has other enhancements added, particularly when using larger CSS files. Because your CSS code is smaller in size and more optimized, your pages will load faster</p>
<h2>How to do this?</h2>
<p>1. Go to the <a href="http://www.feedthebot.com/tools/css/">Minify CSS tool</a>.</p>
<p>2. Enter CSS code into tool</p>
<p>3. Click "minify"</p>
<p>4. Copy new code</p>
<h2>Properly Minimized CSS code improves page speed</h2>
<p>No matter how you use your CSS (<a href="http://www.feedthebot.com/pagespeed/inline-small-css.html">inlined</a>, external files, <a href="http://www.feedthebot.com/pagespeed/combine-external-css.html">combined external file</a>) smaller is better and will help your webpages load faster.</p>
