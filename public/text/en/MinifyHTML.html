    class="summary-rec">Compacting HTML code, including any inline JavaScript and CSS contained in it, can save many bytes of data and speed up downloading, parsing, and execution time.

      <p>Minifying HTML has the same benefits as those for minifying CSS and JS: reducing network latency, enhancing compression, and faster browser loading and execution. Moreover, HTML frequently contains inline JS code (in &lt;script&gt; tags) and inline CSS (in &lt;style&gt; tags), so it is useful to minify these as well.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This rule is experimental and is currently focused on size reduction rather than strict HTML well-formedness. Future versions of the rule will also take into account correctness.</p>
