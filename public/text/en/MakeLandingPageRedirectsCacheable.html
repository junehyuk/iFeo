<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Many pages, especially mobile pages, redirect users to a different
URL, for instance from <code>www.example.com</code>
to <code>m.example.com</code>. Making this redirect cacheable by the
user's browser can speed up page load times for repeat visitors to a
site.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>While the best practice with redirects is to remove them wherever
possible, it can sometimes be difficult to eliminate landing page
redirects, especially redirects to mobile-specific sites. For
instance, the mobile version of a site may be served from a different
web server, which can require redirecting to a different hostname. In
these cases, it's important to make the redirect to the
mobile-specific site cacheable, to reduce page load times for repeat
visitors. If the mobile version of your web site is served from the
same web server as the desktop version of your site, you should
instead eliminate mobile-specific redirects and serve from the same
URL as your desktop page.</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>Mobile-specific redirects must be privately cacheable, in order to
prevent proxies from serving the mobile redirect to non-mobile
users. We recommend using a 302 redirect with a cache lifetime of one
day. The redirect should include a <code>Vary: User-Agent</code>
header as well as a <code>Cache-Control: private</code> header. These
headers prevent proxies from serving mobile-specific redirects to
non-mobile users. You may also want to include an <code>Expires</code>
header in the past, to prevent old HTTP/1.0 proxies from caching these
redirects and serving them to non-mobile users.</p>
